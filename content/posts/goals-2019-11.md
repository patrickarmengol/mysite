This is my first goal tracking post. Initially, I was tracking these in a text file. When I made this site, I moved it over to the resources section, but found that it wouldn't scale well and that posts would be a better organization method. It would also force me to acknowledge my failures rather than editing the month's items.

## Reviewing October 2019 Action Items

As November is when I started tracking these, there is nothing to review.
