## Reviewing November 2019 Action Items

- finish [Practical Malware Analysis - Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig](https://nostarch.com/malware)
  - I finished the book, but did skip over some sections that I thought were obsolete
  - I did not finish all of the exercises; some of this is bc the samples were written for XP and my FLARE VM is on 7
- continue [A Guide to Japanese Grammar - Tae Kim](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar)
  - got to around halfway through the book
  - studying Japanese is fun
- continue [Remembering The Kanji 1 - James W. Heisig](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921) to reach 2000 kanji
  - I reached 1400; I think the goal I set was way too high
- re-read [Neuromancer - William Gibson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/888628.Neuromancer)
  - good book
- 40x situps, pushups, squats per day
  - this wakes me up; but I don't feel like I'm progressing much
  - the pushups are hard and need to be spaced out
- hiking once per week
  - found some new spots that are less crowded than my usuals
- starcraft 1hr after work per weekday
  - starcraft is fun but I feel guilty for playing it
- build a personal website
  - I did this and it's a lot of fun to work on, even if nobody reads it
  - my organizational skills have improved
  - keeping my bookmarks on here is convenient, especially for sharing
  - I'm a bit lost on what I should write about in blog posts
