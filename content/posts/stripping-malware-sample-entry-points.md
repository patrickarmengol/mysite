## Backstory

While going through [Malware Data Science](https://www.malwaredatascience.com/), I noticed that the malware samples included in the book's 'code and data' download had their entry points redacted.

![show_ep_value](/static/stripping-malware-sample-entry-points/show_ep_value.png)

I'm assuming this was done so that live samples wouldn't be hosted directly from the site, or so that people working through the book would be unable to accidently infect themselves.

I thought it would be a nice exercise to create a tool to do this for a given directory of samples.


## Project

I've written a short script and put it up on github.
https://github.com/patrickarmengol/EPstripper

Feed it a file or directory and it will create a copy of each PE file with its entry points replaced.
