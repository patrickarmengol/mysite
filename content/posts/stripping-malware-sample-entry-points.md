## Backstory

While going through [Malware Data Science](https://www.malwaredatascience.com/), I noticed that the malware samples included in the book's 'code and data' download had their entry points redacted.

![show_ep_value](/img/stripping-malware-sample-entry-points/show_ep_value.png)

I'm assuming this was done so that live samples wouldn't be hosted directly from the site, or so that people working through the book would be unable to accidently infect themselves.

I thought it would be a nice exercise to create a tool to do this for a given directory of samples.


## Project

I've written a short script and put it up on github.
https://github.com/patrickarmengol/EPstripper

I utilized the [pefile](https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile) library to parse and edit PE files. 

### Usage

Feed it a file or directory and it will create a copy of each PE file with its entry points replaced.

```
usage: epstripper.py [-h] [-r EP_VAL] input

a script to strip the entrypoints of PE files

positional arguments:
  input       input file or directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -r EP_VAL   specify replacement value - else will use default 0xcc00ffee
```
