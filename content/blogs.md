title: "Security Blogs"
draft: false
---

I have compiled a list of security blogs below. For a period of about 3 weeks, I had tried to keep up with these blogs through an RSS feed reader. It was a futile effort and not something I would recommend to the average security person. I ended up spending a majority of my free time reading about criminals doing crime when I would have much rather been learning something new or making something cool. That is not to say that the blogs are useless; some of them have fantastic writeups, especially for people doing TI. Podcasts are the alternative that I have turned to and they keep me satiated. My favorites for general news are Security Now and Risky Business.
