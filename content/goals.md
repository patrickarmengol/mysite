## Method

Not to seem like I'm having a midlife crisis at 26 or anything, but I feel like I've wasted a lot of time doing much of nothing important. I recently started using a system for personal improvement that I found worked for me:

1. List out your interests
2. Determine why they interest you
3. Define achieveable "end" goals
4. Find concrete items that can help you achieve those goals
5. Divide those items into monthly milestones, picking one or two for each interest
6. Plan out time for each day/week to work on those goals
7. Set alarms on your phone
8. [Do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)

Step 7 was probably the most important one for me as I'm particularly prone to procrastination. The alarms force me to shift my attention from whatever I am doing, to what I should be.

A popular motivational technique shared online is to set rewards for yourself at certain milestones. I don't think that works for most people as it's very easy to just say "screw it, i'm buying that game! all my friends are playing it, why don't I get to??" and then stop working at whatever it was you were trying to achieve because you caved in to one temptation. In my eyes, reaching the goal IS the reward.
