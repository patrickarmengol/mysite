## Method

Not to seem like I'm having a midlife crisis at 26 or anything, but I feel like I've wasted a lot of time doing much of nothing important. I recently started using a system for personal improvement that I found worked for me:

1. List out your interests
2. Determine why they interest you
3. Define achieveable goals
4. Find concrete items that can help you achieve those goals
5. Divide those items into monthly milestones, picking one or two for each interest
6. Plan out time to work on those items
7. Set alarms
8. [Do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)

Step 7 was probably the most important one for me as I'm particularly prone to procrastination. The alarms force me to shift my attention from whatever I am doing, to what I should be. I have 10 alarms set to go off every day and a few more scattered through the week.

In the past, I have tried to use rewards at certain milestones as incentives, but I just ended up saying "screw it, I'm buying that new smash bros game! all my friends are playing it, why don't I get to??" and then I stop working at whatever it is I was trying to achieve because I caved in to one temptation. Now, my view is that the act of reaching the goal IS the reward.
