Welcome. Initially, I had built this site as a professional profile, but that got boring and I hated trying to show off. Now it's more of a personal blog, intended mostly for myself.

## Interests

These are the things that keep me occupied (or at least keep me from watching anime and browsing reddit). I'll try to post about my ventures as I progress through them.

- AI / ML
- Agriculture
- Drawing
- Go (board game)
- Hardware
- Hiking
- Language Learning
- Piano
- Reading
- Reverse Engineering
- Security
- Space
- Starcraft
- Tea
- Travel
