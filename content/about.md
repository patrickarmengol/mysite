## This Site

Hello there! Welcome to my brain's dumping ground. The inspiration to create a personal website came from reading through the monthly discussions on Hacker News about the advantages of doing so. Also, I like reading security blogs and would like to post my own research findings here while practicing my technical writing. That said, I want to use this site, not as a professional portfolio, but more as a means to organize and share my knowledge, ideas, thoughts, and resources.

This is kind of a big leap for me as I've had close to no online presence, especially with social media. If you search my name, you will probably only find [a research paper I wrote at uni](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7366991) (relating to privacy), some French people with the same name, and a few inactive accounts on various sites.

## Who Am I?

Patrick!

### Interests

These are the things that keep me going (or at least keep me from watching anime and browsing reddit). I try to encorporate as many of them into my [monthly goals](/goals), but I always leave some out. I'll try to post about my ventures as I progress through them.
